# Senbonzakura food

This is my first React "big" project. This poject is web app for ordering food. <br>

## Technologies

Technoloies used in this project are: ReactJS, ReactDOM, React Router, Redux, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. This project is live on Firebase and Netlify domain.

## Note

I started this project few days before ZenDev hackaton was annouced so I rushed about some things to make it in time since I was busy with a lot of things. <br>
I think this project has pretty lean HTML (JSX) and CSS code (Bem methodology) as well as React component managment and JavaScript logic. <br>
This project includes things which React begginer/junior without job experience should have, such as:
- useState, useEffect hooks,
- props chaining,
- conditional rendering, 
- unique styling (css modules)
- Fragments, Portals
- Handling side effects
- Sending http requests,
- Custom react hooks
- Redux, Reduxjs/Toolkit, Advanced redux
- React Router (Multi Page SPA)
- React page deployment

This poject has cool premium design as well.

Some features aren't added yet such as searchbar and login. Main reason for saerchbar is because backend data isn't in best shape. For login, I didn't have time to make logic for creating acces token and stuff bound for that.  

---

There is one bug in this project and that bug happens when you work with pagination. Search params update themselves but when you copy and paste link app doesn't workl like it should.

In future, I will continue to developing this application to be realworld poject.
